# Housing in Mexico
OBJECTIVE 
Using a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine if real estate prices are influenced more by property size or location. 

RESEARCH QUESTION
LOCATION OR SIZE: What Influences House Prices in Mexico?
1)	What state has the most expensive real estate market?
Do house prices vary by state? If so, which are the most expensive states for purchasing a home.
2)	Is there a relationship between home size and price?

METHODS
During my exploratory data analysis, I used descriptive statistics like mean and median to get an idea of the typical house price in Mexico. I broke the calculation down by state and visualized the results. I also used scatter plot to see if the two variables are correlated (If an increase in home size is associated with an increase in price).

CONCLUSION
Mexico City (Distrito Federal) is by far the most expensive market. Additionally, many of the top 10 states by GDP are also in the top 10 most expensive real estate markets.
From the Scatter plot and correlation coefficient there’s a weak relationship between size and price. This means that the relationship between size and price in many states does not hold true in the country’s biggest and most economically powerful urban center because there are other factors that have large influence.
